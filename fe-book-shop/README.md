I have tried to apply Form validation using Formik and Yup, also password MD5 hashing
for more than 4 hours, but I keep getting many errors that I can not solve myself.
So, finally I decided not to use Form validation yet. I will learn them on the other
day when there is no time limit. I am just realized that Frontend is more difficult than Backend :o
